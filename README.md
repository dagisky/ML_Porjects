## Studying Public Mobility During COVID19 Outbreak In US
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus or (2019-nCoV).
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness
As of the time of this post, most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Most countries are under lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus including the USA. Across the United States, governors are rolling out a patchwork of constantly evolving plans to relax social distancing restrictions. 

Here we Study Public mobility During the COVID19 outbreak. By studying the community mobility and the transmission of the virus, we can have a better understanding of the heavy toll it took on the US.

For this purpose, we use Google Community Mobility dataset (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)
And Kagle dataset for COVID19 cases in the US https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa
