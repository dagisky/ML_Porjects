# Studying Public Mobility During COVID19 Outbreak In US
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus or (2019-nCoV).
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness
As of the time of this post, most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Most countries are under lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus including the USA. Across the United States, governors are rolling out a patchwork of constantly evolving plans to relax social distancing restrictions.

### Installation
The code would require any version of Python 3, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries

### Project Motivation
Here we Study Public mobility During the COVID19 outbreak. By studying the community mobility and the COVID19 progress we hope to get better view of.
1. The heavy tall it took on the US
2. How the out break is progressing in different states
3. How the outbreak is affecting the daily activity of the community
4. The effects of the lockdown have on the transmission of the virus

### File Descriptions
For this purpose, we use Google Community Mobility [dataset](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). Containing movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. We also used COVID19 Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa
). The COVID19 dataset includes daily reports of confirmed COVID19 cases along with hospitalized, deceased, and under critical conditions.


### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the MEDIUM post available [here.](https://medium.com/@dagmsky/studying-public-mobility-during-covid19-outbreak-f9030f9feadf)
